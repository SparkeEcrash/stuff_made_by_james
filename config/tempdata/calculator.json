	"body": "<p>This was a calculator that I made for a coding bootcamp called Learning Fuze. The idea was to create a calculator that used Javascript to interpret the keys the user clicked (or pressed) in order to perform arithmetic equations. The tricky part was to make sure that the calculator was unbreakable. For instance, pressing, 1 and then + and then 2 is straightforward. Javascript can interpret it as 'var ans = 1 + 2;'. However, what happens&nbsp;if the user presses 1 and then + and then - and then 3?&nbsp;Javascript would give an error for 'var ans = 1+-3' but a calculator would be able to adjust doing 'var ans=1-3'. Another interesting thing to note is that if a user presses '2' and then '.' and then '2', the number is clearly a decimal 2.2. However how do we code it so that a string of 2 and a period and a 2 can be interpretted correctly as an integer with a decimal value?&nbsp;<\/p><p>Â <\/p><p>The calculator was supposed to be a week long assignment but I was able to finish it in one day. What gave me the edge over everyone else was that the vast majority of my classmates were resorting to using arrays to store the keys that were pressed and then translating the strings into an arithmetic equation when the equal key was pressed. I didn't see the need to use arrays. I realized that there were only three values that mattered and the three values were the number before the operand, the operand, and the number after the operand. Rather than using&nbsp;arrays and trying to perform complicated functions that translated strings into arithmetic equations, I designed my code to store the correct values for the three values I mentioned&nbsp;as the user clicked one button at a time. This made the task significantly easier.<\/p>",
