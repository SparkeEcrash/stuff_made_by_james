	"body": "<p>Contact Directory is an app that I made from scratch using PHP, jQuery, and MySQL. I wanted to create what I thought was the best and most responsive data table. Having worked a lot with data entry in my professional career, I've come to realize how time consuming it was to switch between forms for adding, deleting, and editing. I knew it was possible to have CRUD functionality in one table and that was what I sought to do with this data table. Users are able to update any information on the table as they go without having to resort to edit forms. The validations are done on the spot so that the user gets instant feedback on what needs to be changed. I also implemented a search and CSV export feature in order to make the datatable have enhanced features.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Â <\/p><p>Making this data table required a good understanding of PHP and MySQL. I have programmed as a system developer using Laravel for three years so making this data table was not particularly challenging. I knew it was important to set up a thorough validation checking process as well as to make sure that MySQL injections were blocked. The data table uses an id that is stored in the browser's local storage to make sure that data uploaded from one client is not accessible by another. However, all information get stored in a MySQL database so information you upload will be accessible by me. Don't worry though.&nbsp;I don't plan on selling anybody's contact information to some marketing company for a quick cash grab.<\/p>",
